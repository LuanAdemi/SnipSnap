# SnipSnap 

###  a stylish snippet-manager that lives in your menu bar



SnipSnap is currently under development, but I look forward to release an alpha version of it.

Yet, you still can build it yourself if you cant wait:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/LuanAdemi/SnipSnap
cd SnipSnap
npm install
npm start
```
